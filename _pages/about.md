I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Montreal Robotics and Embodied AI Laboratory](https://montrealrobotics.ca/) (REAL) at the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and the [Mila-Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), where I work with [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/). I am interested in several areas of robotic planning, perception, and learning, but a common theme in my research is the assertion that robots are complex tools that must interface with humans at many stages of design, development, and deployment in order to achieve their full effect. My work often focuses on how users and developers can be factored in to both the design and operation of the robot to improve both autonomy and overall system function, in a sense re-designing different robotics subsystems to leverage reliable human resources within pre-, on-, and post-deployment frameworks. Most recently I have been working on several reinforcement learning projects investigating how and why different forms of state augmentation and constraint specification (some from human data) can lead to safer, more efficient policies and policy learning.

Before joining REAL, I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), where I found a home in both the [Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics](https://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/) and the [Resource Bounded Reasoning Laboratory](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/research/), directed by [Rod Grupen](https://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/~grupen/) and [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/), respectively. My [thesis](https://samernashed.github.io/files/SamerNashedThesis.pdf) proposed Multi-SLAM systems, a meta-reasoning framework for dynamically selecting between multiple SLAM front-end modules depending on the sensor stimuli afforded by the current environment. For example, in low-light lasers or structured light may be better, and in clutter or bright light cameras may be more reliable. Prior to graduate school, I earned a B.A. in physics and computer science from [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/).
