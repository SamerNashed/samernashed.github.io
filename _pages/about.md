I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Montreal Robotics and Embodied AI Laboratory](https://montrealrobotics.ca/) (REAL) at the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and the [Mila-Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), where I work with [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/). I'm interested in xyz. most recently...

Before joining REAL, I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), where I found a home in both the [Laboratory for Perceptual Robotics](https://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/) and the [Resource Bounded Reasoning Laboratory](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/research/), directed by [Rod Grupen](https://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/~grupen/) and [Shlomo Zilberstein](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/shlomo/), respectively, who also co-chaired my thesis committee. someting about thesis? I earned a B.A. in physics and computer science from [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu/).
